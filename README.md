# Parroton Core

Parroton is a decentralized, permission-less, open-source yield optimization protocol on TON blockchain. Visit [parroton.org](https://parroton.org) for more information or try our [Mini App](https://t.me/parroton_bot).

Parroton consists of these 3 components:

**[Contract](https://github.com/KStasi/parroton-core)**: The smart contract code that is running on-chain.

**[Webapp](https://github.com/Digberi/parroton)**: The web application that helps users with deposits and withdrawals.

**[Restaker](https://github.com/Digberi/parroton-bot)**: The off-chain bot that restakes rewards to generate more yield for depositors.

To learn more about each component, please refer to the README files in the respective repositories.

The project has participated in [The Open League Hackathon | TON](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/361/buidl). If you find it useful, please consider [supporting us on Dorahack](https://dorahacks.io/buidl/13164) or simply join [our community](https://t.me/MadFishCommunity).
